## Assembly 

![the whole sewn component](images/whole.png)

The fin structure of Airpup is assembled as individual panels which are then joined by edge binding along the length of the Keel Pockets.

Most stitches are a 3mmx3mm zigzag stitch, unless specified. 

### Keels

### Grouping Assembly Tasks
The assembly is easier to perform if edge binding and other tasks are grouped. This is my suggested order.

1. Tack Winglet Pockets and Winglet Reinforcements to one side of Winglets tips.

2. Tack Keel Reinforcements to both sides of Keel tips.

3. Edge bind two exposed sides of Keel and Winglet.

4. Edge bind back edge of Wing.

6. Sew Keel Reinforcements to Keels.

7. Sew Bridle Loops to Keels.

8. Tack and sew Keel Pocket to Keel.

8. Sew Wing Pocket onto front edge of Wing.

9. Align one edge of Keel, Winglet, and Wing to the back corner of polyester panels.

10. Tack together Keel, Winglet, Wing, and Keel Pocket.

11. Edge bind.

12. Align other side of Keel, Winglet, Wing and Keel Pocket, aligning to back corner.

13. Edge Bind.

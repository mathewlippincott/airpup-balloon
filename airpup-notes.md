# Airpup Notes

## Safety
Airpup is a kite. Exercise safety guidance and judgement appropriate to kites. Avoid flying when lightning threatens or near power lines. Always check the weather before flying. Airpup cannot be safely handled in winds exceeding 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour).

## Preflight Setup: adjusting angle of attack
Before flying, ensure Airpup's nose is pointed upwards, either by balancing the payload on belly rails or by adjusting the bridle (see below). The spars along Airpup's sides should be inclined approximately 15 degrees or more before taking to the air.

Failure to set upward angle of attack will result in unstable and potentially hazardous flight behavior. 

## Bridle adjustment
Your Airpup is rigged to fly with a payload on the belly. If you do not intend to mount a payload on the belly, the bridle must be adjusted.

The bridle is modular and has preset knots for setting an appropriate angle of attack without a belly-mounted payload. Remove the 10.5" strings from the rear legs of the bridle and shorten the front leg of the bridle to the upper knot.

## Inflation and deflation
Always use a balloon regulator to fill Airpup through the small nozzle. Approximately 37 cubic feet of gas will provide a complete fill. Upon filling, the balloon skin will be taught and the belly seam's wrinkles behind the payload mount will smooth out.

To empty Airpup, pull the dump valve.

Do not blow into Airpup with your breath! Moisture can degrade the balloon. A high-volume pump (such as for inflatable boats) or inflatable mattress pump are the best choices for air filling.

## Inserting Spars
For your convenience, the side spars are pre-installed on Airpup, and one side of the three-part transverse spar has been installed for demonstration purposes.

Before flying, ensure that all spars are together and snuggly within their pockets.

## Payload specifications
Airpup can lift approximately 600 grams fully inflated, and even more with wind assistance; however, a 500g or smaller payload is recommended.

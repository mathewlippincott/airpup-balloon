This repository contains the 2D patterns for constructing [Airpup](https://headfullofair.com/tags/airpup) as well as a corresponding 3D model. 2D patterns are made with [QCAD](https://qcad.org), the 3D model was made in Audodesk's Fusion 360.

See more of my kite and balloon projects at [headfullofair.com](https://headfullofair.com).

### mounting rails
The folder */rails* contains CAD files and STLs for end caps and two-part slide mount:

### envelope construction

The envelope is a 3-gore pattern seamed in a single run:

### envelope volume and flat patterns

Airpup's envelope volume is roughly equivalent to a sphere whose radius is 1/3 the length of an inflated Airpup.

Airpup's flat envelope pattern is 1.147 times the length of an inflated Airpup.

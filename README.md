This repository contains the 2D patterns for constructing [Airpup](https://headfullofair.com/tags/airpup) as well as a corresponding 3D model, and a volumetric calculator. 2D patterns are made with [QCAD](https://qcad.org). The 2D pattern for the fins is diagramatic only.

See more of my kite and balloon projects at [headfullofair.com](https://headfullofair.com).

### envelope construction

The envelope is a 3-gore pattern seamed in a single run:

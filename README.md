# the Airpup kite balloon

This repository contains the 2D patterns for constructing [Airpup](https://headfullofair.com/tags/airpup) as well as a corresponding 3D model. 2D patterns are made with [QCAD](https://qcad.org), the 3D model was made in Audodesk's Fusion 360.

![rendering of airpup](images/airpup-render.png)

* [/rails](rails), *belly mounting rails and STLs*
* BOM.ods, *Bill of Materials*
* V3-FIN.DXF, *panel diagram of the fin/wing structure and attachment*
* V3-ENVELOPE.DXF, *flat pattern of the balloon envelope*
* 72in-Airpup-model-v3.f3z/step/iges, *full-size 3D Airpup- Envelope is accurate in size, volume, and seam locations, fins are illustrative.*

Fin and envelope flat patterns have a series of rounded-rectanges that correspond to the glued interconnections joining the sewn fins and envelope. 

### sewing assembly
[airpup-assembly.md](airpup-assembly.md) contains instructions on sewing Airpup. 

### envelope construction

The envelope is a 3-gore pattern seamed in a single run:

### envelope volume and flat patterns

Airpup's envelope volume is roughly equivalent to a sphere whose radius is 1/3 the length of an inflated Airpup.

Airpup's flat envelope pattern is 1.147 times the length of an inflated Airpup.

### mounting rails
The folder [/rails](rails) contains CAD files and STLs for end caps and two-part slide mount. This mount allows easy weight adjustment and also can be removed from the belly of the balloon through four patches

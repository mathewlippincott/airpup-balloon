# 1. Purpose
This project intends to include the largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible by providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines community expectations as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. Everyone is invited to help create safe and positive experiences.

# 2. Project Culture
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is encouraging participants to recognize the relationships between words and actions, and their effects on our project's culture.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure this project is welcoming, friendly, and encouraging to all participants, please recognize their efforts.

* No weapons will be allowed at meetings or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. 

Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item intended for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.

# 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a project member engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the project without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

# 7. Reporting Guidelines
